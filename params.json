There are some helper libraries such as [`glu`](https://github.com/go-gl/glu) and [`glh`](https://github.com/go-gl/glh), if you want help getting started drawing some basic primitives, using framebuffers or shaders.\r\n\r\nA good starting point would be to take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/tree/master/testdata) in glfw project.\r\n\r\n### Need help or want to contribute?\r\n\r\nHelp is always welcome. We can be found on [#go-gl on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=maria&prompt=1) and are welcome to ask any questions, but you might have to idle a while before getting a response. Graphics help can also be found on #opengl.\r\n","name":"go-gl"}
